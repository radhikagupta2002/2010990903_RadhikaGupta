		  Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gita Krishna declares: Whenever and wherever there is a decline in dharma (religious practice) and a predominant rise of adharma (irreligion), at that time Krishna descends to protect the pious and to annihilate the miscreants. Thus He appears millennium after millennium to reestablish the principles of religion.

Five thousand years ago, Krishna appeared in the village of Vrindavana and performed various pastimes to give pleasure to His devotees. He also killed various demons who were trying to disturb the innocent people of Vrindavana. The uncommon activities of Sri Krishna are divine and even great sages like Narada glorify these transcendental acts. Devotees are always eager to hear about the adventurous pastimes of the Lord in His various incarnations, especially the superhuman acts He performed in the forests of Vrindavana, along with His elder brother Balarama.
